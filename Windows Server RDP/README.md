# Windows server

## New Resource Group

I will create a new resource group so it's easy to separate this server resources from ELK's.

## The server

I will be using a `Windows Server 2016` with Azure Spot Discount.

All other options are set as the cheapest and weakest versions in order to save money as this will not be a demanding server.

\* Connection through port 3389 has to be allowed or you will be locked out out of the server
